📖 About
This project is a Space-based To-Do List Manager that helps users stay organized by allowing them to create and manage multiple Spaces. Each Space acts as a separate workspace, containing its own To-Do List.

Within each Space, users can:

Create, edit, and delete tasks

Pin important tasks to prioritize them

Mark tasks as completed

Set and manage task deadlines

Filter tasks by various criteria

Additionally, tasks that miss their deadlines are visually highlighted in red, helping users quickly identify overdue items.
