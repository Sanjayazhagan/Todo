📖 About
This project is a Space-based To-Do List Manager that helps users stay organized by allowing them to create and manage multiple Spaces. Each Space acts like an independent workspace and contains its own To-Do List.

Within each Space, users can:

Create, edit, and delete tasks

Pin important tasks to keep them at the top

Mark tasks as completed

Assign deadlines to each task for better time management

The project is designed for productivity enthusiasts who want to compartmentalize their tasks across different contexts (e.g., Work, Study, Personal) while retaining a simple and intuitive interface.
